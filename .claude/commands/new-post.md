Create a new blog post with the following frontmatter:

```md
---
title: 'New post title'
pubDate: YYYY-MM-DD (today's date)
description: 'A short description of the post'
showDate: true
tags: tag1, tag2
isDraft: true
---

Write the post content here below the frontmatter.
```

Add the post to the `content/blog/year` directory, where `year` is the current year. The filename should be the post title in kebab case, `.md`.
