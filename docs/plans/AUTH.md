# Astro Admin Authentication Implementation Plan

## Intention & Goals

Implement a secure, cookie-based authentication system for **single-user admin access** to the website. This will enable future admin functionality like content management, analytics dashboard, and other administrative features.

### Key Requirements

- Simple cookie-based session management (no client-side JavaScript required)
- Single admin user (Eric) - no multi-user complexity needed
- Environment variable configuration for credentials
- Protection for `/admin/*` routes via middleware
- Secure logout functionality
- Works with existing Netlify deployment
- Compatible with Astro v5.x and current project structure

## Technical Approach

- **Authentication Method:** Username/password with simple session tokens
- **Session Storage:** HTTP-only cookies with secure random tokens (no JWT complexity)
- **Route Protection:** Astro middleware for `/admin/*` paths
- **Rendering Strategy:** Modern Astro 5.x hybrid approach using `output: 'static'` + adapter
- **Deployment:** Netlify with environment variables
- **Security:** HTTPS enforcement, secure cookie flags, token expiration
- **Scope:** Single admin user system - simple and effective

### Rendering Mode Rationale

Astro 5.0+ simplified hybrid rendering by removing the explicit "hybrid" mode. The new approach:

- **Global Config:** `output: 'static'` (default) with Netlify adapter configured
- **Performance:** Most pages stay static for optimal performance
- **Selective SSR:** Auth pages use `export const prerender = false` for server-side rendering
- **Best of Both:** Static performance + dynamic auth functionality when needed

This gives us hybrid behavior without complex configuration - static pages by default, with server-side rendering only where authentication is required.

## Project Configuration Analysis

### Current Setup

- ✅ Astro v5.12.2 (compatible with modern hybrid approach)
- ✅ `@astrojs/netlify` adapter installed
- ✅ TypeScript project setup
- ✅ `output: 'static'` configured with Netlify adapter (modern hybrid approach)
- ✅ Configuration builds successfully
- ✅ Ready for selective SSR using `export const prerender = false`

### Required Changes

- [x] ~~Update `astro.config.mjs` for hybrid rendering + Netlify adapter~~ ✅ **Completed**
- [ ] ~~Install JWT library (`jose`)~~ ❌ **Not needed** (using Node.js crypto)
- [ ] ~~Add crypto utilities if needed~~ ✅ **Node.js built-in crypto sufficient**

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
# .env (local development)
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-chosen-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
ADMIN_SECRET=your-long-random-secret-key-32-chars-minimum
```

### Netlify Environment Variables

For production deployment, configure these environment variables in Netlify:

**Site Settings → Environment Variables:**

- `ADMIN_USERNAME` - Your chosen admin username
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Your secure admin password  
- `ADMIN_SECRET` - A cryptographically secure 32+ character secret key

**Security Notes:**
- Generate `ADMIN_SECRET` using: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`
- Use a strong password for `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (consider a password manager)
- Never commit these values to version control - they should only exist in `.env` (local) and Netlify environment variables (production)

## Security Considerations

- **Simple but Secure:** Single admin user = simpler security model
- **Password Security:** Simple string comparison (appropriate for single-user system, avoids timing attack complexity)
- **Session Management:** Simple token expiration (24-hour default, configurable)
- **Token Generation:** Cryptographically secure random tokens (Node.js crypto module)
- **HTTPS:** Enforce secure cookies in production
- **Rate Limiting:** Implemented via Cloudflare edge-level protection (documented)
- **Audit Logging:** Plan for admin activity logging if needed
