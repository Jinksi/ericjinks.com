There are good reasons why you would choose to use [**Day.js**](https://day.js.org/) instead of [**Moment.js**](https://momentjs.com/) for date manipulation.

- The smaller bundle size
- TypeScript support out of the box
- The fact that **Moment.js** is [no longer maintained](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/)

But the main reason that I'd recommend **Day.js** is that it's immutable. What does this look like in practice?

Say you have a date for an event and you want to create a reminder one day before the event.
With **Moment.js** you'd do something like this:

```jsx
// Moment.js
const newYearsDay = moment('2024-01-01');
const newYearsEve = newYearsDay.subtract(1, 'day');
```

At a glance, this looks fine ‚Äì but what if we want to render both of these dates?

```jsx
// Moment.js
<span>{newYearsDay.format('YYYY-MM-DD')}</span> // 2023-12-31 üò±
<span>{newYearsEve.format('YYYY-MM-DD')}</span> // 2023-12-31
```

Oh no! We've mutated the original date!
This sort of bug is hard to spot and I've been a victim of this specifically with Moment.js a few times.

Sure, you could use `clone()` to avoid this, but that's just more cognitive load.

```jsx
// Moment.js
// Use clone() to avoid mutating the original date, if you remember to do so
const newYearsEve = newYearsDay.clone().subtract(1, 'day');
```

Let's use **Day.js** instead üòé.

```jsx
// Day.js
const newYearsDay = dayjs('2024-01-01');
const newYearsEve = newYearsDay.subtract(1, 'day');

<span>{newYearsDay.format('YYYY-MM-DD')}</span> // 2024-01-01 üëç
<span>{newYearsEve.format('YYYY-MM-DD')}</span> // 2023-12-31
```

Much better! Now we can use the original date without worrying about mutating it or having to clone it.

*Here's a browser-rendered example comparing both libraries, assuming the approach detailed above is used for both:*

<HighlightBox sourceHref="https://github.com/jinksi/ericjinks.com/blob/master/src/content/blog/2023/_DayVsMoment.svelte" type="svelte">
  <DayVsMoment client:visible />
</HighlightBox>
