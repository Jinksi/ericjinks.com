In a recent technical interview, I was asked to implement undo/redo functionality for a canvas drawing app using _Event Sourcing_. I had never explored this concept before, so I am writing this post to learn about it and apply it in a React component.

## So, what is Event Sourcing?

Event sourcing is a state design pattern in which state is not stored directly. Instead, **all changes to state are captured as a sequence of immutable events**, and current state is reconstructed by replaying these events.

The name "Event Sourcing" comes from the fact that **events are the source of truth** for the application's state. Rather than storing the current state directly, you "source" (derive) the state from a sequence of events.

In a basic sense, normal state management can be thought of as a single object:

```tsx
const state = {
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
}

const setPosition = (x: number, y: number) => {
  state.x = x
  state.y = y
}

// State update A
setPosition(10, 20)

// State update B
setPosition(55, 75)

// Accessing the current state
state.x // 55
state.y // 75
```

Event sourcing will instead manage state as a sequence of events:

```tsx
const events = []

const setPosition = (x: number, y: number) => {
  events.push({ type: 'setPosition', x, y })
}

// State update A
setPosition(10, 20)

// State update B
setPosition(55, 75)

// Events array includes the history of all state changes
// [
//   { type: 'setPosition', x: 10, y: 20 },
//   { type: 'setPosition', x: 55, y: 75 },
// ]

// We can directly access the latest state object
const state = events[events.length - 1]
state.x // 55
state.y // 75

// Or we can derive the current state by replaying the events
const state = events.reduce(
  (acc, event) => {
    if (event.type === 'setPosition') {
      acc.x = event.x
      acc.y = event.y
    }
    return acc
  },
  { x: 0, y: 0 }
)
```

## What sort of things can we do with event sourcing?

**Undo/Redo Functionality**

Rather than storing full snapshots, you store user actions as events. Then we can undo or redo by moving the backward and forward in the event history.

**Multi-user Collaboration**

If multiple users edit shared state (e.g. Figma or Notion), recording user events provides a way to merge, reconcile, and audit edits.

**Time-Travel Debugging**

Tools like Redux DevTools implement a form of event sourcing. Actions (events) are stored and can be replayed to reproduce any application state.

**Optimistic UI**

You can immediately apply an event on the frontend (e.g. "CommentPosted") before the server confirms it, and reconcile later if needed.

**Audit Trail & Replay**

Some apps (e.g. finance, health) need traceable state histories. Event logs provide a complete, replayable, and auditable history of frontend interactions.

## Implementing undo/redo in a React component with event sourcing

<HighlightBox
  type="react"
  sourceHref="https://github.com/jinksi/ericjinks.com/blob/main/src/components/react/EventSourcingUndoRedo.tsx"
  wide={false}
>
  <EventSourcingUndoRedo client:load />
</HighlightBox>

The component above demonstrates event sourcing with undo/redo functionality. Here are the key parts:

### 1. Event Types

Events represent actions that can happen, similar to Redux actions:

```tsx
type CanvasAction = {
  id: string
  type: 'ADD_CIRCLE' | 'ADD_SQUARE'
  x: number
  y: number
  size: number
  color: string
}
```

### 2. Event Store

The store maintains both the event history and current position in that history:

```tsx
type EventStore = {
  events: CanvasAction[]
  historyIndex: number // Tracks where we are in the timeline
}
```

### 3. Event Reducer

Handles adding new events and navigating through history. If we're not at the end of the history, we truncate the future events, starting a new set of events from this point.

```tsx
const eventReducer = (
  store: EventStore,
  action: CanvasAction | UndoRedoAction
) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_CIRCLE':
    case 'ADD_SQUARE':
      // Truncate future events if we're not at the end (branching)
      const truncatedEvents = store.events.slice(0, store.historyIndex)
      return {
        events: [...truncatedEvents, action],
        historyIndex: store.historyIndex + 1,
      }
    case 'UNDO':
      return { ...store, historyIndex: Math.max(0, store.historyIndex - 1) }
    case 'REDO':
      return {
        ...store,
        historyIndex: Math.min(store.events.length, store.historyIndex + 1),
      }
  }
}
```

### 4. State Reconstruction

Current state is derived by reducing over the event list up to the current history index.

In more complex systems, this process can be optimised using snapshotsâ€”periodic captures of state that reduce the number of events needing to be replayed.

```tsx
const getStateFromEvents = (events: CanvasAction[], historyIndex: number) => {
  const currentEvents = events.slice(0, historyIndex)
  return currentEvents.map((event) => ({
    id: event.id,
    type: event.type === 'ADD_CIRCLE' ? 'circle' : 'square',
    x: event.x,
    y: event.y,
    size: event.size,
    color: event.color,
  }))
}
```

The key insight used to implement this is that **undo/redo simply involves moving the history index backward and forward**, while the current state is always reconstructed from the events up to that index.

This approach naturally handles complex scenarios like branching, which occurs when you undo several steps and then perform a new action.
