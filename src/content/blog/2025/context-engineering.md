The term **"context engineering"** is catching on as a superior replacement for **"prompt engineering,"** and I think it's a helpful reframe.

As [Simon Willison notes](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/27/context-engineering/), the problem with "prompt engineering" is that most people's inferred definition reduces it to "typing things into a chatbot", missing the inherent complexity entirely.

Simon also quotes Tobi Lütke (Shopify CEO), [who captures it well](https://x.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127):

> _I really like the term “context engineering” over prompt engineering._
>
> _It describes the core skill better: the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM._

The shift from "prompt" to "context" reframes the work from _just_ crafting a clever instruction. It's not about what you ask, but about all of the context you provide and all of the careful trade-offs that go into it.
