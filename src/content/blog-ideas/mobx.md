## Topics to explore

• **Mental model shift**: Redux actions/reducers vs MobX observables/reactions
• **Basic state setup**: Store creation and React integration patterns
• **Reading state**: `useSelector` vs direct observable access
• **Updating state**: Dispatching actions vs direct mutation with `runInAction`
• **Derived state**: Reselect selectors vs MobX computed values
• **Async operations**: Thunks/Sagas vs Flows
• **Performance**: Manual optimisation vs automatic tracking
• **Developer experience**: DevTools, TypeScript, testing approaches
• **When to choose**: Team fit, project requirements, migration considerations
