[What is this?](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses/)

## Editor & Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is my favourite font (with ligatures)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is my go-to terminal
- Safari is my main browser. It's kind of the NS10 of browsers (if it works in Safari, it probably works everywhere else). Firefox Developer Edition, Edge and Chrome get use as well

## Mac apps I can't live without

- Many default mac apps: Notes, calendar, mail.
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) as a more useful alternative to Spotlight.
- [Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/) for a mini calendar in the menu bar.
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for a more intuitive reminders app.
- [Notion](https://notion.so) for documenting work and life, project management, etc.
- [Next DNS](https://nextdns.io/) for adblocking, tracker blocking, privacy and security enhancements on all of my devices.
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) for password management.

## Desk setup and computers

- MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2018) for work
- MacBook Pro (15-inch, early 2013) for personal use & music (really want to upgrade this but it's still kicking)
- A PC that I rarely use but has a decent enough GPU for machine learning things, both Ubuntu and Linux
- Apple Magic Mouse for moving the cursor on screen
- Apple wired keyboard with numeric keypad for typing things (I like these original keys better than the newer magic keyboard)
- [Ikea LÅNGFJÄLL chair](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/langfjaell-office-chair-gunnared-blue-white-s09252512/)

- [Focusrite Saffire Pro 24](https://resource.focusrite.com/en/firewire-audio-interfaces/saffire-pro-24) audio interface. It uses FireWire (which sucks nowadays) but works well will the [Thunderbolt 2 Firewire adapter](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MD464ZM/A/apple-thunderbolt-to-firewire-adapter) plus a [Thunderbolt 3 to 2 adapter](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter)
