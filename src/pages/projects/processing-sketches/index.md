This is a collection of interactive & generative sketches written with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library, which is a derived from [processing](https://processing.org/). I previously had these as the backdrop to my website.

Inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/) and his [Nature Of Code book](http://natureofcode.com/).
